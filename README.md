# pet-feeder-project

This project is a programmable automated pet feeder. An animal shelter is looking for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder that can dispense food for cats and dogs, monitor the amount of food that has been consumed, along with alerts or notifications that are sent through the app to staff if an issue arises, such as, no food has been dispensed or food has not been eaten. This solution to the animal shelter's problem has included low-cost parts including servo motors and sensors as mass production of the product needs to be low-cost.
