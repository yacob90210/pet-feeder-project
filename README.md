# pet-feeder-project

#This project is a programmable automated pet feeder. An animal shelter is looking for a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder that can dispense food fro cats and dogs, monitor whether food has been consumed or the amount of food that has been consumed, along with alerts or notifications that are sent to staff if an issue arises, like no food has been dispensed or food has not been eaten. This solution to the animal shelter's problem has included low-cost parts including servo motors and sensors as mass production needs to be lost-cost.
