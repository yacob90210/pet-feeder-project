Some other refinements that could drastically improve the programmable automated pet feeder could be adding a pre-feeding low food alert/notification to the app, potentially one hour before original feeding time. Another potential refinement would be adding different portion sizes for different pets but that could be included in the app to be easily programmable along with a manual override for feeding times in case problems arise.
